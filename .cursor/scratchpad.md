# RSVP Management App - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested an RSVP management application with the following key features:
- Physical invites with QR codes that recipients can scan
- QR code scanning leads to a form where guests can enter their information and RSVP
- RSVP data is submitted back to the host
- Host management interface for creating invites, managing invitees, viewing details, and updating event info
- QR code generation functionality
- All data storage in Google Drive

This is a comprehensive event management solution that bridges physical and digital experiences, making it easy for hosts to manage events and for guests to respond conveniently.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **QR Code Generation**: Need to generate unique QR codes for each invite that link to specific RSVP forms
2. **Google Drive Integration**: Authentication, file management, and data storage in Google Drive
3. **Mobile-Responsive Design**: QR code scanning typically happens on mobile devices
4. **Data Security**: Ensuring RSVP data is properly secured and only accessible to authorized hosts
5. **Unique Invite Management**: Each physical invite needs a unique identifier to prevent duplicate responses

### Architecture Considerations:
1. **Frontend**: Web application accessible via QR codes (mobile-first design)
2. **Backend**: API service for handling RSVP submissions and data management
3. **Database**: Google Drive as primary storage (may need local database for performance)
4. **Authentication**: Google OAuth for host authentication
5. **QR Code Service**: Generate and manage unique QR codes per invite

### User Experience Challenges:
1. **Seamless QR Code Experience**: Guests should have a smooth experience from scan to submission
2. **Host Dashboard**: Intuitive interface for managing events and viewing responses
3. **Offline Capability**: Consider if any offline functionality is needed
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure works across different devices and browsers

**Required Manual Steps**:
The user needs to run these commands manually in the terminal:

```bash
# 1. Install missing dependencies first
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y xvfb xserver-xorg-video-dummy xbase-clients python3-packaging python3-psutil

# 2. Install Chrome Remote Desktop
cd ~/Downloads
sudo dpkg -i chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb

# 3. Fix any dependency issues if they occur
sudo apt-get install -f

# 4. Start the Chrome Remote Desktop service
sudo systemctl enable chrome-remote-desktop
sudo systemctl start chrome-remote-desktop
```

**Next Steps**: After manual installation, we can proceed with configuration and setup.

### Recent Issue Resolution (2025-09-26)
**Issue**: Host dashboard was failing to fetch Google authentication, showing "fails to fetch the google auth" error.

**Root Cause**: The host dashboard was missing proper Google Sign-in integration. The JavaScript was trying to work in "simplified mode" without authentication, but API calls were failing.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Added Google Sign-in button to host dashboard header
2. Updated JavaScript to handle authentication flow properly
3. Added proper OAuth callback handling
4. Implemented session management with localStorage
5. Added proper error handling and user feedback

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Host dashboard now has proper Google authentication flow
